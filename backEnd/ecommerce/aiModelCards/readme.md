As all modules in the ecommerce the model is responsible for trades on models.
So that users can trade their model, the weights and/or the chat history.
Some attributes of the model must be shown as the product like tier,
number of games played and won or lost, the wining trend (is it improving over time)
The base modle, is finetunning data include or not, and the overall ranking of the 
model plus the price.

An ecommerce model is a form of object to perform bid and ask in order
to trade models for instance Jackie has a model which she has trained and fine tuned
while playing games and exploring the platform and the web through interaction and feedback
(later can be expanded to SLMs or other types of model with custom combinations or architecture)
The ecommerce models has to main parts one part related to describing the model:
overall-rank,specific use case (the model is a fitness trainer, just a companion, content creator, mathematician,
...), rank by subject(usecase), some model detail[could be optional or unlocked later]: underlying model, number of 
tokens, parameters, games played, etc.
The part related to commerce will contain the price, current best bid.
The ecommerce service in a nutshell is about people trading their models
(Or later models trading their submodels or weights with other models or users using the platform's currnecy)
